  <h2 align="center">Developer Experience Team<br/>Standards of Practice</h2>
  <hr />
</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>

The Developer Experience team is on a mission: **_we accelerate and simplify the integration of Ping and ForgeRock products into customer apps and websites_**.

We are responsible for the following open-source projects:

 - [ForgeRock SDK for Android](https://github.com/ForgeRock/forgerock-android-sdk)
 - [ForgeRock SDK for iOS](https://github.com/ForgeRock/forgerock-ios-sdk)
 - [ForgeRock SDK for JavaScript](https://github.com/ForgeRock/forgerock-javascript-sdk)
   - [ForgeRock Token Vault](https://github.com/ForgeRock/forgerock-javascript-sdk/tree/develop/packages/token-vault)
 - [ForgeRock Login Widget](https://github.com/ForgeRock/forgerock-web-login-framework)

We will also be collaborating on the _Unified SDK_, bringing the best of both Ping and ForgeRock functionality to the fingertips of developers.

Success requires constant collaboration between contributors; each with their own skills, backgrounds, and beliefs.

This _Standards of Practice_ document establishes our expectations for behavior for working with each other on our mission.

> As common as it may be to believe that technology is neutral, apolitical, unbiased and decoupled from the people and culture that produced it, we believe differently. 
> 
> We believe that technology is a reflection of who we are as a community, so it’s best to be explicit about what we believe.

# Standards of practice

These standards of practice apply to all open-source projects managed by the _Developer Experience_ team.

## Culture

Our _primary_ belief is that treating individuals with **respect**, **empathy**, and **inclusivity** is fundamental to our continued success.

> We believe in the power of including diverse experiences, backgrounds, educations and ideas into our daily processes, strongly influencing the development of our products.

As we interact with each other, we are mindful to enforce these shared values:

1. Psychological safety and mindfulness
2. Diverse organizations and inclusive collaboration
3. Proactively communicate and passionately listen
4. Build with empathy
5. Intellectual humility
6. All leaders, no owners
7. Innovate and inspire
8. Balance and harmony

## Security

The software we create is often on the critical path for our customers. We must ensure we follow best practice for SDKs, libraries, and frameworks.

> Because we build things that hundreds of millions of people use, we have to ensure that we build things that never risk their safety, privacy and security, no matter how valuable or fashionable we believe it may be.

Learn more about our **_security_** guidelines:

* [General security](security/security-guidelines.md)
  * [Android-specific security](security/security-guidelines-android.md)
  * [iOS-specific security](security/security-guidelines-ios.md)
  * [Web-specific security](security/security-guidelines-web.md)


## Technical

As a diverse team of contributors, we believe it is vital to share our expectations for the code we write, and how we write it.

As such, below we outline some technical aspects of creating our products, including the tools we use, our code style, performance requirements, and how we undertake version control.

> Don't think of these as mandates or commandments, but guidelines and suggestions that help us build quality, maintainable code as a collaborative collective.

Learn more about our **_technical_** guidelines:

* [Performance guidelines](performance)
* _Code style:_
  * [Android code style](code-style/android-coding-standard.md)
  * [JavaScript code style](code-style/js-styleguide.md)
* [Version control](version-control.md)
* [General JavaScript guidelines](js-standards.md)
