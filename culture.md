# Engineering culture

As common as it may be to believe that technology is neutral, apolitical, unbiased and decoupled from the people and culture that produced it, we believe differently. We believe that technology is a reflection of who we are as a community, so it’s best to be explicit about what we believe. 

## 1. Psychological safety & mindfulness

(Emotional intelligence; empowering others; conflict resolution; trust; good faith; respecting others)

We believe that long-term success is only achieved when psychological safety is fundamental to our organization. This means we trust that one another is acting in good faith and we have a goal of reaching a shared understanding.

## 2. Diverse organizations & inclusive collaboration

(Collaboration; empowering others; sharing knowledge; uplifting others)

We believe in the power of including diverse experiences, backgrounds, educations and ideas into our daily processes, strongly influencing the development of our products. Respecting each other and our diversity is paramount, but only the first step. We must welcome and advocate for such diversity.

## 3. Proactively communicate & passionately listen

(Team alignment; conflict resolution; collaboration; sharing vision and goals; empowering others; emotional intelligence; listening skills)

We believe communicating early and often is paramount to our collective success. Speaking up and speaking out is always welcome. Think aloud with teammates, share your understanding, reduce ambiguity, properly & critically review your own ideas ... it's all about being proactive about communication early to reduce surprises, conflicts and tech debt in the future.

We also believe that everyone should be passionate about hearing what others have to say. Rather than just waiting for an opportunity to speak, mindfully listen to others and give them the space and encouragement for them to complete their thoughts. Only after that, you be inclusive of what was previously said in your statement, rather than an unrelated, pre-existing thought.

## 4. Build with empathy

(Accessibility & usability; advocating for others; community impact)

We believe everything we build needs to be developed with a deep consideration for all users, not just the ones that "reflect" us. Because we build things that hundreds of millions of people use, we have to ensure that we build things that *never* risk their safety, privacy and security, no matter how valuable or fashionable we believe it may be.

## 5. Intellectual humility

(Strong opinions, loosely held; accountability; anti-fragility; growth versus fixed mindset)

We believe intelligence has little value without the recognition that it’s fallible.

## 6. All leaders, no owners

(Leadership; inspire; collaborate)

We believe everyone should be given the opportunity to lead, regardless of their title. We also believe that no one individual owns anything; it’s all shared.

## 7. Innovate & inspire

(Creativity; autonomy, mastery & purpose)

We believe innovation and inspiration is at the core of true success. For this to happen, we believe the following are vital for each individual:

- Autonomy
- Mastery
- Purpose

> … the secret to high performance and satisfaction – at work, at school, and at home – is the deeply human need to direct our own lives, to learn and create new things, and to do better by ourselves and our world.

## 8. Balance & harmony

(Work-life balance; self-care; mental health; support each other's wellness)

We work hard, but we rest & reset. We stop and celebrate our successes and support each other through the failures. Importantly, we support each other when we've worked hard, encouraging others to take time off and reset when they need it.
